  - title: Theory
    shortDescription: The **Theory** working group will address the current lack of shared conceptualizations concerning the nature of opinions and their expression.
    body: The **Theory** working group will address the current lack of shared conceptualizations concerning the nature of opinions and their expression. We will bring together the necessary theoretical perspectives to foster the exchange of knowledge and develop a common understanding of opinions and their expressions in digital information environments, including journalism studies, discourse studies, media policy, political communication and information science.Â Building and disseminating an integrated terminology of opinion research and measurement and establishing the study of opinionated text as a vibrant field of research, we aim to enable inter-disciplinary research on opinions in the digital age.
  - title: Tools
    shortDescription: The **Tools** working group will address the limited scope and accessibility of most existing computational tools for the analysis of opinionated text.
    body: The **Tools** working group will address the limited scope and accessibility of most existing computational tools for the analysis of opinionated text. We will take stock of presently available tools, many of which are developed for (and evaluated on) very specific tasks and kinds of (typically, English) texts, and respond to the pressing needs for adaptation, documentation, validation, and integration to better tailor available tools to common research uses and demands. Establishing a common methodological research agenda, we will identify key focus areas to coordinate collaborative and comparative empirical research on opinions in online settings, aiming to enable inter-disciplinary research on opinions in the digital age.
  - title: Application & Data
    shortDescription: The **Application & Data** working group will address the persistent lack of cumulative experience and gold standards in data management, analysis and validation practices for research on opinionated text.
    body: The **Application & Data** working group will address the persistent lack of cumulative experience and gold standards in data management, analysis and validation practices for research on opinionated text. We will establish a virtual Computational Communication Lab to render available key data sets for cross-lingual and comparative validation and benchmarking, develop critical gold standards for data handling and validation, and provide targeted guidance for the integration and tailored application of tools and resources. Facilitating the evidence-based selection, adaptation and user-friendly application of tools, we aim to enable inter-disciplinary research on opinions in the digital age.
  - title: Inclusion & Dissemination
    shortDescription: The **Inclusion & Dissemination** working group will address the need for computational skillsets to analyze large amounts of opinionated text.
    body: The **Inclusion & Dissemination** working group will address the need for computational skillsets to analyze large amounts of opinionated text. We will set up a dedicated training mission to facilitate the inclusion of early career researchers and scholars from less well-resourced countries and institutions. Organizing summer schools, workshops and short-term scientific missions, we will advance the sustained exchange of knowledge, skills across ages, genders, languages and disciplines, including stakeholders in other scientific networks, politics, regulatory authorities, and industry. Democratizing access to skills, tools and resources, we aim to enable inter-disciplinary research on opinions in the digital age.
