On Thursday, 22 September, the OPINION Management Committee officially launched the network with an inaugural meeting at the COST Organization in Brussels. With 29 representatives from 23 countries, we elected the network's leadership, laid down key policies for the conduct of the network, and created four working groups (on Theory, Tools, Data & Application, and Inclusion & Dissemination). Commencing our discussions, we focused on how to make the most out of the exciting joint work over the coming four years. Read the Minutes of the MC Meeting here: (to be added)
