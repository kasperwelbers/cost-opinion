On Thursday, 22 September, the OPINION Management Committee officially launched the network with an inaugural meeting at the COST Organization in Brussels. With 26 representatives from 23 countries, we elected the network's leadership, laid down key policies for the conduct of the network, and created four working groups (on Theory, Tools, Data & Application, and Inclusion & Dissemination). Commencing our discussions, we focused on how to make the most out of the exciting joint work over the coming four years.

These were the key decisions taken:

ELECTIONS

The Management Committee has unanimously elected:

A huge congrats to all of the elected officials, I am looking forward immensely to bring this network to success!

The ten elected officers named above jointly make up the "**Core Group**", which will act as executive committee of the network.

In this context, the MC has created the position of Grant Holder Vice Representative (see above), as well as the positions of Vice Grant Coordination Officer as well as two Vice Chair positions per WG. It has also decided that the Science Communication Officer (see above) will act as WG4 Vice Chair *ex officio*.

All Core Group positions have thus been elected. **The remaining eight positions** - Vice Grant Coordination Officer, 2 WG1 Vice Chairs, 2 WG2 Vice Chairs, 2 WG3 Vice Chairs and one WG4 Vice Chair - **will be elected at the first joint WG Meeting**.

NETWORK POLICIES

The Management Committee has adopted a range of policies that will guide the work of our action. Generally speaking, the purpose of these policies will be to make sure that our network will be broad and inclusive, but at the same time remain able to work in a focused and collaborative manner, while focusing our scarce resources on supporting active participation. In particular, the Management Committee has decided the following (I have highlighted those policies that directly affect your participation):

**Meetings**

1. Physical network-wide meetings shall be held in conjunction with other events (e.g., MC meetings, Conferences) as much as possible.
2. Physical WG meetings shall be held in conjunction with network-wide meetings as much as possible.
3. Online WG meetings are at the discretion of the WG.
4. WGs can **lay down criteria** or **create tasks** that need to be met **for participants to be invited** to a WG meeting.
5. Physical meetings shall be announced at least 6 weeks in advance; Online meetings shall be announced at least 3 weeks in advance.
6. MC Members who cannot attend a physical MC meeting shall nominate a substitute only if their country would otherwise not be represented.

**Reimbursement**

1. By default, all participants invited to WG or MC meetings shall be **reimbursed fully**, in accordance with COST rules.
2. **If budget constraints require**, the CG can decide to:

   1. **lower the default reimbursement rate, in order to maintain full reimbursement for junior and ITC participants**;
   2. **limit full reimbursement to only one MC member per country**;
   3. only partly reimburse guests.

      This should be announced at least 4 weeks prior to affected meetings.

**Membership**

1. WG membership applications shall be approved generously, as long as the applicant’s contribution to the WG is made clear.
2. **Participants can be full members of up to two WGs**, but can follow the communications of as many WGs as they wish.
3. After MC1, WGs advise the CG on the approval of new WG memberships.
4. WGs can decide to advance less generous rules for approval in order to:

   1. safeguard membership diversity or
   2. safeguard their ability to achieve WG objectives.

      Any restrictions must respect inclusiveness and fairness principles.
5. **WG membership entails a commitment to active participation.**
     **WGs can request the removal of members who have persistently violated this requirement** over the past grant period.
     Any termination of WG membership remains subject to CG validation.

**Grants**
Grants can be issued to both members and non-members of the network. **Priority** shall be given to activities that involve **junior members** as well as **ITC members and institutions.**

**Communications**
All communications:

1. by the CG, addressed to the entire network
2. by the WG leadership, addressed to all WG members

   shall be made **publicly available**, in a manner that enables potential collaborators beyond the network to contribute, via the web page.

This does not include instructions for joining meetings.

**Review**

1. The above policies shall be reviewed at the first MC meeting after the completion of each grant period, and updated if needed.
2. The MC shall discuss and vote upon any policy revisions proposed by any 2 CG members, any WG leadership, or MC members from 5+ countries.
3. All network members shall be informed promptly about adopted policies; current policies shall also be made publicly available via the web page.
4. Unless decided otherwise, policies come into effect 30 days after notification.

We furthermore decided to establish publication targets and author/adoption rules within one year.

In addition to establishing the above network policies, the MC has established the mandates for the Core Group, Working Groups, and Management Committee.

WORKING GROUP APPLICATIONS

The MC has approved the applications of 102 applicants to join OPINION Working Groups.

However, in line with the decision on **limiting the number of WGs** wherein a participant can simultaneously be a full member **to two**, that means that **some applications were approved conditionally** upon these applicants revising their applications to select up to two WGs only. Any approved applications that already comply with these requirements are approved as is. All applicants will be informed about this decision.

Please note that we also decided that participants can subscribe to the email communications of as many WGs as they like, so you can still follow what is going on in WGs that you are not a full member of.

NEXT STEPS

The Management Committee discussed the Work and Budget Plan, which will be formally established and decided upon in the next weeks. Core stipulation of said plan is that there will be **two network-wide meetings** in the first Grant Period - one in **Winter**, tentatively in **Amsterdam**, and one in **Summer**, in an **Inclusion Target Country** (if you might be interested in hosting that meeting, please reach out). Dates will be sought as soon as possible once the Work and Budget Plan is formally adopted.

We will also host an informal **get-together at the ECREA European Communication Conference** in Aarhus in one month's time. This will not be a formal network event, so we will not reimburse any travel costs, but if you happen to be at ECREA, please feel warmly invited to drop by.
