The second OPINION masterclass lecture took place during the Action’s meeting at the University of Salamanca (Spain), on June 12, 2024. The lecture entitled **The Good, The Bad, and The Generated: Opinion Mining with (local) AI** was delivered by **Dr. Johannes B. Gruber**, Post-Doc Researcher at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 

A text as data enthusiast and promoter of open-source tools to analyze political and media discourse, Dr. Gruber introduced Ollama to the OPINION members, an unsupervised machine learning tool that can be used to classify, analyze, and extract insights from large amount of information. The Ollama platform allow users to run LLMs locally, which makes the computational analysis of communication and opinion mining more accessible and easier to reproduce.
