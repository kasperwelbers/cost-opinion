OPINION’s first masterclass lecture took place during the Action’s meeting at the Cyprus University of Technology – CUT (Limassol), on January 19, 2024. 

The lecture entitled “Reframing text mining on social media as a survey research task” was delivered by Dr. Konstantinos Gemenis, Assistant Professor of Politics and the Internet in the Department of Communication and Internet Studies at CUT. Dr. Gemenis’s talk addressed the challenges of applying text mining to study opinionated communication in social media. He suggested that advertising their survey on Facebook might help researchers overcome many of these challenges when measuring public opinion on a specific topic.
