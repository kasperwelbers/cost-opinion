In an era increasingly shaped by digital communication and the rapid advancements in generative artificial intelligence, understanding the complexities of 'opinions' is more critical and challenging than ever. The COST Action project, "What are Opinions? Integrating Theory and Methods for Automatically Analyzing Opinionated Communication (OPINION)", raises this challenge by fostering a shared, interdisciplinary understanding of how opinions are formed, expressed, and interpreted.

 

WG1 (THEORY) has created a brand-new Glossary of key terms and definitions to assist researchers working on opinionated communication as part of the COST Action.  Born from the collaboration of over 30 scholars from 13 countries and diverse fields—including linguistics, political communication, public opinion research, and media studies—this glossary aims to provide a coherent, theoretically grounded resource for anyone studying or reporting on opinionated communication.

 

***New resource***

 

Why is such a glossary vital now, especially for academics and news sources?

The proliferation of generative AI blurs traditional lines and demands a precise lexicon. Consider, for example, the term 'opinion holder.' The glossary created by this group of scholars defines an 'opinion holder' as "an entity that holds an opinion about a specific topic... a person, organization, country, or some other specific group of people expressing an opinion." Traditionally, this entity possesses agency and intent.

 

However, when a generative AI model produces text that expresses a viewpoint, who is the 'opinion holder'?, Is it the AI itself that lacks genuine belief or consciousness?, Is it the programmer who designed the algorithm?, The organization that deployed the AI?, The user who prompted the AI?, Or the vast dataset of human opinions on which it was trained. The OPINION Glossary provides the foundational understanding necessary to dissect these questions. 

 

For news sources and journalists, the OPINION Glossary is an indispensable tool for reaching accuracy and clarity in opinion research, by ensuring precise language when reporting on public sentiment, AI-generated content, and the sources of various claims. The glossary can enhance responsible reporting, because it can help avoid misattributing opinions to AI entities as human agents, thereby maintaining journalistic integrity and public trust. Furthermore, it offers critical engagement to journalists, by providing the conceptual tools to question and investigate the origins and implications of machine-generated texts that mimic human opinion.

 

For scholars, this glossary offers a common interdisciplinary language. This means facilitating more robust and nuanced research into how opinions (human or seemingly AI-generated) are constructed and perceived. It also provides a theoretical springboard, by enabling scholars to "rethink" established concepts like 'opinion holders' in light of new technological realities and to develop new frameworks for analysis. Moreover, it offers a basis for empirical studies by supporting investigations into the impact of AI on public discourse and the formation of public opinion.

 

By consulting this glossary, readers will be able:

\-                to identify meaning of bias, like confirmation bias, where people seek out information that supports their existing beliefs, or narrative fallacy, where incomplete information leads to misleading conclusions;

\-                to improve critical thinking which assumes that recognizing bias enables individuals to question assumptions, analyze information more objectively, and avoid cognitive distortions;

\-                to enhance research and analysis for scholars, professionals, and AI developers that can use these definitions to refine studies on subjective communication, sentiment analysis, and automated opinion evaluation;

\-                to promote fair and balanced discussions by understanding bias, that helps individuals engage in more rational and evidence-based conversations, reducing prejudice and misinformation.

 

***Example:  The term “Emotion” in the Glossary*** 

 

The inclusion of the term “emotion” in an academic glossary is not merely a matter of semantic precision; it is crucial for any scholarly community engaged in discussions about media, politics, psychology, and cultural analysis to have a comprehensive understanding of the term “emotion”. 

 

The literature, ranging from Aristotle and Descartes to Sara Ahmed and George Marcus, reveals that emotion is a deeply contested and multidimensional concept. Therefore, a glossary entry for this term must do more than define it; it should clarify theoretical tensions, map disciplinary usages, and highlight contextual functions across various fields.

 

For example, the glossary addresses the conceptual complexity and theoretical tensions of the term: Emotion is a highly debated concept that exists at the intersection of several areas. In Biology and universality (Ekman, Plutchik, James) the emotions are innate, evolutionary responses. In Rationality and ethics (Aristotle, Descartes) the emotions are linked to judgment and persuasion. In Culture and social norms (Hochschild, Mesquita, Matsumoto) the emotions are culturally constructed performances. In Power, discourse, and identity (Ahmed, Shields) the emotions are political and ideological tools. In Media and politics (Marcus, Mac Kuen, Small & Lerner) the emotions are drivers of opinion and behavior.

 

A glossary helps reconcile or at least present these tensions, offering a meta-understanding of how the term functions in both theory and practice. It can clarify usage across social and discursive contexts: Emotion operates differently depending on the context. In political discourse, emotions such as fear or hope are leveraged to legitimize action or build ideological allegiance. In media discourse, emotions drive narratives and shape public engagement. In everyday social life, emotions enforce norms and regulate group inclusion or exclusion.

 

Without a glossary that maps these discursive roles, users may overlook the strategic function of emotion in shaping reality, identity, and power. In an era where emotions are increasingly instrumentalized in political rhetoric, social media, and identity politics, clarifying their academic usage is more essential than ever.

 

***More information***

 

The OPINION Glossary is a "work-in-progress" designed to evolve alongside our understanding of opinionated communication. It is a starting point for a larger "joint manifesto on conceptual criteria and dimensions of textually expressed opinions."  By offering clear, collaboratively developed definitions, the OPINION project empowers researchers and media professionals to navigate the intricate landscape of opinions with greater precision and insight, especially as we grapple with the transformative influence of generative AI.

 

We encourage academics, journalists, and students to engage with the OPINION Glossary to enhance their work and contribute a more informed understanding of opinion in the 21st century.
