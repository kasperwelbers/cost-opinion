The third OPINION masterclass took place in Lyon (France) on January 13, 2025, during the Action’s meeting at the Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1. The lecture entitled “What also non-nerds need to know about recent advances in computational methods” was presented by Professor[ Damian Trilling](https://damiantrilling.net/en/), Chair of Journalism Studies at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 



In his lecture, Prof. Trilling addressed the rapid advancements in technology, particularly in AI, and how these developments have influenced computational methods for analyzing communication. He critically examined the tools and techniques currently employed in computational analysis of opinionated communication, highlighting that many are outdated and have proven to be unreliable, despite their recent usage. Research indicates that even the most reputable dictionaries may not be the optimal choice for analysis. Depending on specific research objectives, supervised machine learning, large language models (LLMs), and generative LLM tools often provide superior options for automatically analyzing opinions in large textual datasets. However, Prof. Trilling warned that “LLMs are no panacea”; he emphasized the necessity of validating their performance against a gold standard (i.e., manually annotated data) to ensure methodological reliability.
