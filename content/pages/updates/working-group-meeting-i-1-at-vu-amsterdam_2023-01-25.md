For this Working Group Meeting, we are guests of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

The Meeting venue will be at the VU Main Building (“Hoofdgebouw”), which is located at 1105 De Boelelaan, 1081 HX Amsterdam, in Amsterdam South. Access to the Main Building is from De Boelelaan, with all our meeting rooms located toward the left after you enter, in wing A at the Faculty of Social Sciences. Please follow the signs once inside the building.

The Vrije University Amsterdam is located within walking distance from the Amsterdam South (Zuid) station. The below map shows the location of the VU campus relative to the station and the four recommended hotels.

**FOLLOW ONLINE / RECORDING**

- - -

Both the Plenary sessions and the Working Group sessions will be streamed and recorded, so that also participants who cannot attend in person can follow the discussions.

There will not be a full hybrid format, though. Online participants can post questions or comments via the chat, which may be relayed by the session chairs if there is time, but interactive discussions will focus on on-site participants.

The recordings will be made available to all members after the meeting.

Please note that both online participation and access to the recordings are limited to members of the Network only, and you are not permitted to re-share access.

**PRACTICAL INFORMATION: Before the meeting**

*Preparations*

You will be contacted by the chair of your Working Group(s) before the meeting with additional information about the planned discussions. You won’t need to prepare anything specific, however, it will be greatly appreciated if you can already think about the questions raised, think of concrete ways in which you believe you can and would like to contribute, and maybe think of useful resources that you may be aware of that might be of interest to your WG.
If you are a member of multiple Working Groups, you may wish to decide beforehand – and if possible, let us know – which WG’s physical meeting you intend to participate in. Since the Working Group sessions will be held in parallel, you will not be able to attend both meetings. You will be able to access the recording of the sessions that you missed afterwards.

*Candidacy for WG Vice Chair*

At the end of the Working Group sessions, each WG will elect up to two WG Vice Chairs. WG Vice Chairs support the WG Chairs in their coordination of Working Group activities and take on specific responsibilities within the WG (e.g., liaising with the Science Communication Officer).
If you already know that you wish to submit your candidacy to become Vice Chair of a Working Group, please contact your relevant Working Group chair. You can still register your candidacy during the Working Group Session.
It is also possible to run as WG Vice Chair if you cannot physically attend the Working Group meeting. In this case, it will be important that you notify your WG Chair beforehand and provide a short candidate statement (up to 1 page) or video (up to 3-5 min) in place of your personal introduction in the meeting.

*Attendance Lists*

In order to receive reimbursements for your expenses, you are required to document your participation by signing the attendance list. If you do not sign the attendance list, we will not be able to reimburse you, so please make sure you do not forget this. Please note that separate attendance lists will be available at each session listed in the program.

*Wifi*

For the duration of the Working Group meeting, you will be able to connect to the eduroam network or the VU Amsterdam’s Wifi network, using a code that will be announced on the morning of the meeting.

*Lunch*

Participants are expected to buy their own lunch, the costs of which are covered by the Daily Allowance that will be part of your reimbursement (see below). We have reserved a separate seating area in the VU Amsterdam’s main Cafeteria. From there, you can access any lunch options that the Cafeteria has to offer, and pay yourself, before returning to our seating area.

*Coffee*

Coffee, tea, juice and water will be offered during breaks in the program.

*Dinner*

There are no plans for a centrally organized dinner. If you spend the evening after the Working Group meeting in Amsterdam, we would like to encourage you to find yourselves together in smaller groups, and use the evening to get to know one another a bit more. There are several conveniently located restaurants and bars next to the Amsterdam South station, and of course countless more all across town.

*Minutes & Recordings*

All minutes and recordings of the Working Group meeting, concerning both the plenary sessions and the Working Group sessions, will be made available to all members, including those who did not participate in person, within two weeks after the meeting.

*Tasks*

Each Working Group may decide to define specific tasks that members are expected to fulfil in order to be invited to subsequent meetings. Any such decisions will be communicated to all Working Group members by the WG chairs shortly after the meeting. These communications will also include information regarding how and by when such tasks should be completed.
