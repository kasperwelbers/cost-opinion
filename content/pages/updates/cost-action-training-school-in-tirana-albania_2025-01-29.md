### ﻿

### **Algorithmic Bias**

Algorithmic bias refers to the prejudices embedded in algorithms due to biased training data, which can perpetuate inequality. This topic focuses on identifying and mitigating these biases to ensure fairer outcomes in areas like AI and decision-making systems.

### **SNA (Social Network Analysis)**

SNA is the study of relationships and structures within networks. It involves using mathematical and computational models to analyze interactions in social networks, helping identify patterns, influencers, and information flow.

### **Multi-lingual**

This topic addresses the challenges of processing multiple languages in technology and data systems. It covers techniques for handling automatic translation, comprehension, and analysis across different languages.

### **Multi-modal**

Multi-modal refers to using various types of data (text, images, audio) to enhance analysis and understanding in tech systems. It explores applications of combining different data sources for more comprehensive insights.
