**The inaugural OPINION Working Group meeting will take place on Friday, 27 January 2023, at the Vrije University Amsterdam.** 

THE PROGRAM

The official program will cover the entire day, starting at 9:00 and ending at 18:00. We will commence with a **plenary session** introducing the network and its objectives, as well as some key information about the COST program and its opportunities. For most of the day, we will **split into the four working groups** and discuss how each WG will address its objectives and organize its work. At the end of the day, we will reconvene for a **plenary discussion** of the respective groups' planned agendas and strategies.

Please note that the **WG sessions will be held in parallel**. If you are a member of more than one WG, you will thus need to decide which session to attend. For each WG, the WG Chair will contact you before the meeting with some more information about the planned program, and inform you what, if anything, you might be asked to prepare for the meeting.

At the end of the WG session, each WG will elect up to two **WG Vice Chairs**; if you might be interested in taking responsibility in your WG, please reach out to the relevant WG Chair before or during the meeting.

TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS

The Meeting will take place at the **[Vrije University Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/)** main building, which is located in [De Boelelaan 1105, 1081HV Amsterdam](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Vrije+Universiteit+Amsterdam/@52.3337568,4.8657199,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x2df2d7a997eccd84!8m2!3d52.3337568!4d4.8657199), close to the Amsterdam Zuid (South) railway station. If you stay overnight, we recommend that you book your accommodation at one of the following four **hotels** (however, if you choose otherwise, that is up to you):

* [Qbic Amsterdam](https://qbichotels.com/)
* [CitizenM Amsterdam South](https://www.citizenm.com/hotels/europe/amsterdam)
* [Olympic Hotel Amsterdam](https://www.olympichotel.nl/)
* [Motel One Amsterdam](https://www.motel-one.com/en/hotels/amsterdam/)

Invited participants are required to make their own travel arrangements. Long-distance travel costs will be reimbursed at face value, while most other costs are covered by a flat daily allowance, following the rules detailed below.

Please note that **only participants that were formally invited will be able to attend the meeting** and claim reimbursement.

REIMBURSEMENTS

Travel costs related to the OPINION Network meeting will be reimbursed as follows:

* **We can reimburse only participants who were invited and confirmed their attendance via the eCOST system, and who actually attended the network meeting** (as documented by an attendance list that will be available at the venue).
* Any **long-distance travel costs** (>100km) will be reimbursed at the value stated on presented tickets, up to a maximum of 1,500 Euro. To ensure smooth reimbursement, we ask you to book only economic connections (within reason, nobody expects you to take a train in the middle of the night or fly with three layovers), and book well in time to avoid unnecessary costs. You may include a cancellation insurance, the costs for which will be refunded as part of the ticket. If you come by car, costs are covered at 0.35 EUR/km, up to 2000 km.
* You can also claim expenses for **visa processing fees** if you need to obtain a visa specifically for attending the network meeting. Such costs will be reimbursed at the value stated on presented receipts or documentation. This does not include any costs related to visa obtained for purposes beyond the network meeting.
* **All (!) other costs** (i.e., accommodation, local transportation <100km, food etc.) are covered by a flat daily allowance, which for the Netherlands amounts to 211 Euro per full day. The daily allowance takes into account your actual travel time from and to your place of origin, not only the day of the event itself, so for longer travels, that will most likely be more than one daily rate.
* Please note that we will, however, not disburse daily allowances for days that you may spend traveling for reasons unrelated to the network meeting: If you put in additional days in Amsterdam for your own reasons, that's up to you, but we will then only consider the time that you would have spent traveling without such intermissions toward your daily allowance.
* Please note also that, if you arrive from or continue to a destination other than your home institution, we will ask you to explain that in your reimbursement claim. If you travel to multiple destinations, we will only refund your travel costs from the preceding and to the next destination, and assume that any other legs of your trip are motivated by other purposes and covered otherwise. You are required to avoid double funding. Claiming reimbursement for expenses that are covered by other sources will be considered a violation of COST rules.
* Also note that it is your responsibility to keep your bank contact data in your COST profile up to date, and to submit your receipts and refund claims within two weeks after the meeting.
