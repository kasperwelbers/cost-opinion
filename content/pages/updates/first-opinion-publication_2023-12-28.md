We are excited to announce the first formal publication coming out of the OPINION Network! Seven authors from Albania, Belgium, Israel, Lithuania, and Poland, all part of Working Group 1 Theory's Linguistics group, just published "Opinion Events: Types and opinion markers in English social media discourse" in the Lodz Papers in Pragmatics, offering a pragmatics-based definition of opinions. And the best thing? It's available Open Access, so you can read it right here, right now: <https://doi.org/10.1515/lpp-2023-0022>

Congratulations to all authors to this fine example of what COST is all about, bringing people together across disciplines, academic cultures and countries, to share their knowledge on a key concern of our times!
