**The second joint OPINION Working Group & MC meeting will take place on Monday, 26 to Wednesday, 28 June 2023, in Prague.** We are guests of the Faculty of Social Sciences at Charles University Prague, kindly hosted by Lenka Vochocová and Jana Rosenfeldová.

THE PROGRAM

The official program for all OPINION Working Groups will commence at noon (12:30) on Monday, 26 June, and end before lunch (12:30) on Wednesday, 28 June.

On Monday, we will commence with a brief plenary session and an opportunity to get to know other network members, before we split up into the separate WG sessions. If you are a member of multiple WGs, you will need to choose which session to attend (unless you solved the challenge of being in two places at once, of course, in which case we would be curious how you do that). Tuesday is wholly dedicated to Working Group sessions. On Wednesday, the WGs will start with a short wrap-up session, before we reconvene for rapports and synthesis in a short closing plenary.

The OPINION Management Committee will convene for a brief session after lunch on Wednesday.

We anticipate that each WGs will organize a joint WG dinner (on either Monday or Tuesday evening, possibly both), for which participation will be voluntary, self-paying and per signing up. After you have confirmed your participation in the meeting, your WGs' leaderships will be in contact with you about any such plans.

TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS

The Meeting will take place at the Hollar building of the Charles University's Faculty of Social Sciences, which is located at Smetanovo nábřeží 6, Prague 1, just South of Prague city center on the banks of the Vltava river. The tram stop Narodni Divadlo (lines 2, 9, 17, 19, 22, 23) is right outside the building, and the closest Metro stop Narodni Trida is only a short 5-min walk away.

We recommend that you book your accommodation at one of the following seven hotels (ordered by price and distance; however, if you choose something different, that is up to you):

- [Pytloun Old Armoury Hotel](https://www.​pytlounstarazbrojnicehotel.cz/​en/](https://www.pytlounstarazbrojnicehotel.cz/en/)

Invited participants are required to make their own travel arrangements. Long-distance travel costs will be reimbursed at face value, while most other costs are covered by a flat daily allowance, following the rules detailed below.

Please note that **only participants that were formally invited will be able to attend the meeting** and claim reimbursement.

REIMBURSEMENTS

Travel costs related to the OPINION Network meeting will be reimbursed as follows:

- **We can reimburse only participants who were invited and confirmed their attendance via the eCOST system, and who actually attended the network meeting** (as documented by an attendance list that will be available at the venue). We will start sending invitations via eCOST in the next days.

- Any **long-distance travel costs** (>100km) will be reimbursed at the value stated on presented tickets, up to a maximum of 1,500 Euro. To ensure smooth reimbursement, we ask you to book only economic connections (within reason, nobody expects you to take a train in the middle of the night or fly with three layovers), and book well in time to avoid unnecessary costs. You may include a cancellation insurance, the costs for which will be refunded as part of the ticket. If you come by car, costs are covered at 0.35 EUR/km, up to 2000 km.

- You can also claim expenses for **visa processing fees** if you need to obtain a visa specifically for attending the network meeting. Such costs will be reimbursed at the value stated on presented receipts or documentation. This does not include any costs related to visa obtained for purposes beyond the network meeting.

- **All (!) other costs** (i.e., accommodation, local transportation <100km, food etc.) are covered by a flat daily allowance, which for the Czech Republic amounts to 191 Euro per full day. The daily allowance takes into account your actual travel time from and to your place of origin, not only the day of the event itself, so for longer travels, that will most likely be more than one daily rate.

- Please note that we will, however, not disburse daily allowances for days that you may spend traveling for reasons unrelated to the network meeting: If you put in additional days in Prague for your own reasons, that's up to you, but we will then only consider the time that you would have spent traveling without such intermissions toward your daily allowance.

- Please note also that, if you arrive from or continue to a destination other than your home institution, we will ask you to explain that in your reimbursement claim. If you travel to multiple destinations, we will only refund your travel costs from the preceding and to the next destination, and assume that any other legs of your trip are motivated by other purposes and covered otherwise. You are required to avoid double funding. Claiming reimbursement for expenses that are covered by other sources will be considered a violation of COST rules.
