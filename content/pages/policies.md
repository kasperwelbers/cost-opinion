<a name="publications"> </a>

**Publications**

1. Joint publications based in the work of the Working Groups (“centripetal”):<br>a. Lead authorship is credited to leading contributors.<br>b. Authorship requires an active contribution (e.g., writing, data collection, …) without which the publication could not have taken its overall shape. Participation in discussions does not constitute a claim to authorship.<br>c. For all publications that arise from the joint work of the Working Groups (“centripetal”), all Working Group members are to be invited to participate and earn authorship if they wish.<br>d. Any Working Group members who are not authors but participated in the joint discussions are to be acknowledged by name in a footnote or acknowledgement.<p>
2. Publications based on collaborations that grow out of the network (“centrifugal”):<br>In accordance with COST adoption rules, OPINION will recognize as network publication any publications that…<br>a. involve at least three authors based at different institutions who are members of the network<br>b. are thematically relevant to OPINION and endorsed as such by any Working Group<br>c. provided that the authors wish the publication to be included as such.<p>

Any publications of the above mentioned types are eligible for support (e.g., for copy editing, translation, open access fees) by the network, subject to available funding.<p>
