## Publications

1. Joint publications based in the work of the Working Groups (“centripetal”):
    1. Lead authorship is credited to leading contributors.
    2. b. Authorship requires an active contribution (e.g., writing, data collection, …) without which the publication could not have taken its overall shape. Participation in discussions does not constitute a claim to authorship.
    3. c. For all publications that arise from the joint work of the Working Groups (“centripetal”), all Working Group members are to be invited to participate and earn authorship if they wish.
    4. d. Any Working Group members who are not authors but participated in the joint discussions are to be acknowledged by name in a footnote or acknowledgement.
2. Publications based on collaborations that grow out of the network (“centrifugal”):
    1. In accordance with COST adoption rules, OPINION will recognize as network publication any publications that…
    2. involve at least three authors based at different institutions who are members of the network
    3. are thematically relevant to OPINION and endorsed as such by any Working Group
    4. provided that the authors wish the publication to be included as such.

Any publications of the above mentioned types are eligible for support (e.g., for copy editing, translation, open access fees) by the network, subject to available funding.

    1. by the Core Group, addressed to the entire network
