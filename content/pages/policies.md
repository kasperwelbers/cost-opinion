### Science Communication Plan

OPINION has adopted a Science Communication Plan that determines the objectives, strategies, and means of the network's outreach activities. The current Science Communication Plan can be downloaded [here](https://www.opinion-network.eu/img/science-communication-plan-2023-07-21.pdf).

### Publications

1. Joint publications based in the work of the Working Groups (“centripetal”):\
   a. Lead authorship is credited to leading contributors.\
   b. Authorship requires an active contribution (e.g., writing, data collection, …) without which the publication could not have taken its overall shape. Participation in discussions does not constitute a claim to authorship.\
   c. For all publications that arise from the joint work of the Working Groups (“centripetal”), all Working Group members are to be invited to participate and earn authorship if they wish.\
   d. Any Working Group members who are not authors but participated in the joint discussions are to be acknowledged by name in a footnote or acknowledgement.
2. Publications based on collaborations that grow out of the network (“centrifugal”):\
   In accordance with COST adoption rules, OPINION will recognize as network publication any publications that…\
   a. involve at least three authors based at different institutions who are members of the network\
   b. are thematically relevant to OPINION and endorsed as such by any Working Group\
   c. provided that the authors wish the publication to be included as such.

Any publications of the above mentioned types are eligible for support (e.g., for copy editing, translation, open access fees) by the network, subject to available funding

- - -

### Open Access

OPINION offers a (limited) fund for supporting Open Access publications that emerge from the network and meet OPINION's <a href="#publications">criteria</a> for network publications.

Open Access support is conditional upon independent peer review (i.e., publications that are not peer-reviewed or where the reviewing is handled solely by affiliated authors are ineligible).

Authors can apply for OPINION's OA support only if they have no other ways of covering Open Access fees.

OPINION aims to support 'centripetal' publications by its WGs as much as possible. Priority will be given to high-impact publications addressing international audiences (e.g., in international journals, with major book publishers).

OPINION aims to cover the full Open Access costs whenever possible, up to a limit of 2500 EUR, but may decide to grant partial support if budgetary constraints require.public

Additional guidance on how to apply can be found <a href="https://www.opinion-network.eu/img/oa-policy.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
