<p><font face="Poppins, Calibri, sans-serif" size="2"><br><br><br>Manipulation refers to the act of influencing or controlling individuals or situations through indirect, deceptive, or coercive means. It involves a calculated effort to shape another person’s thoughts, emotions, or actions to serve the manipulator’s interests, often without the target's full awareness. Manipulation typically operates within asymmetrical power dynamics, where the manipulator possesses greater authority, access to information, or control over communicative channels.<br><br>In Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), manipulation is conceptualised as a covert strategy used by dominant groups to preserve power and perpetuate social inequality. It is defined as ‘a devious way to control others’, involving the illegitimate exercise of influence. Scholars in this field aim to expose how discourse is strategically employed to legitimise domination and maintain ideological hegemony. Teun A. van Dijk offers a cognitive approach to manipulation, placing it within a triangular model of discourse, cognition, and society. He highlights how linguistic choices—such as presuppositions, implicatures, and framing—affect mental models and enable subtle control of beliefs and interpretations. A theory that neglects cognition risks missing how individuals are (often unwittingly) persuaded and led to comply.<br><br>Manipulation is also closely linked to the shaping of public opinion. Media platforms, political institutions, and digital algorithms play a significant role in influencing societal attitudes through disinformation, emotional appeals, and selective exposure. These strategies exploit cognitive vulnerabilities, such as confirmation bias and motivated reasoning, reinforcing polarised views and limiting critical engagement. In this way, manipulation becomes a powerful force in controlling narratives, manufacturing consent, and guiding collective behaviour.<br><br><br><br></font></p>
