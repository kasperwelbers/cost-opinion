<p><font face="Poppins, Calibri, sans-serif" size="2"><br><br><br>Culture can be broadly defined as the set of shared knowledge, beliefs, customs, values, norms, symbols, and practices that are transmitted socially within a group. According to Edward B. Tylor, culture is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society. Pierre Bourdieu expanded on this by demonstrating that culture is not neutral but is deeply embedded in systems of power. Through the concept of 'habitus', he explained how individuals internalise cultural norms in relation to their social position. Culture thus becomes a tool of social reproduction, whereby dominant groups impose their tastes, languages, and forms of legitimacy, often rendering other expressions invisible or illegitimate.<br><br>In digital contexts, culture appears to be more open and participatory, with social media enabling a wide range of users to express themselves. However, this apparent horisontality hides underlying asymmetries. While some voices gain visibility and influence, others — particularly marginalised or minoritised groups — are silenced, overlooked, or subjected to platform-specific forms of algorithmic invisibility. Furthermore, the digital realm introduces a new top-down logic where cultural production is shaped not only by traditional institutions such as the media, education, and government, but also increasingly by commercial platforms. This dual pressure, from both institutions and commerce, reconfigures the production, distribution, and valuation of culture online. As Bourdieu might suggest, in the digital age, symbolic power is maintained not only through social distinction, but also through algorithmic and market-driven mechanisms that reinforce certain norms while excluding others.<br><br><br><br></font></p>
