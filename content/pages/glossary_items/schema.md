<p><font face="Poppins, Calibri, sans-serif" size="2"><br><br><br>A schema is a cognitive structure or mental representation that organises and categorises our knowledge about the world. Schemas function as internal templates that guide our perception, interpretation, and understanding of both linguistic and non-linguistic stimuli. They help us make sense of new experiences by relating them to existing knowledge and expectations. In the framework of Cognitive Grammar, schemas are viewed as dynamic, context-sensitive constructs that shape our conceptualisation of reality. Rather than being fixed or static, schemas are continuously updated through interaction, experience, and language use. They are conceived as networks of interconnected elements (including concepts, relationships, and cognitive operations) which support both linguistic competence and broader cognitive processes. Schemas operate across different levels of abstraction. At the lower end, perceptual schemas organise basic sensory-motor experiences, such as motion, shape, or spatial orientation. At higher levels, conceptual schemas structure more abstract knowledge, such as categories, event types, or social roles. This gradation allows schemas to bridge concrete bodily experience with complex thought. Linguistic expressions evoke or activate schemas. For example, understanding a sentence requires drawing on schematic knowledge of grammar, event structure, and meaning. Thus, schemas play a vital role in the construction of meaning during communication. Moreover, schemas are also embodied. They are grounded in our physical and sensory-motor experiences. This embodied dimension allows for the integration of perceptual, motor, and affective information into conceptual representations, reflecting the close connection between language, thought, and bodily experience. Schemas are therefore not only linguistic tools but also fundamental to human cognition, enabling flexible yet structured conceptualisation across contexts.<br><br><br><br></font></p>
