<p><font face="Poppins, Calibri, sans-serif" size="2"><br><br><br>Communication refers to the dynamic process through which information, meanings, and perspectives are exchanged and co-constructed among two or more participants. It encompasses verbal and non-verbal forms—including written, spoken, visual, and embodied modes such as gestures or symbolic cues—and is not limited to linguistic expression alone. As such, communication serves not only to transmit information but also to shape and negotiate social meanings and relationships according to Habermas.<br><br>Communication is not limited to the exchange of information, but involves the construction of meaning and coordination of social behaviour. It presumes and constructs a system of shared semiotic codes, semantic constructs, and pragmatic behaviours that enable one participant to recognise the likely meaning of others’ communicative behaviour. Rather than being a one-way channel, communication involves both the expression and reception of messages, enabling participants to align interpretations based on shared semiotic codes, pragmatic expectations, and contextual understanding. This alignment facilitates not only coordination of behaviour but also the evolution of individual and collective viewpoints.<br><br>In the context of opinion expression, communication provides the primary mechanism through which individuals articulate, refine, and negotiate their perspectives. It creates opportunities for individuals to encounter alternative views, recognise disagreements, and, at times, arrive at shared or conflicting opinions. Communication thus plays a central role in both personal opinion formation and the collective negotiation of societal beliefs and attitudes.<br><br>From a sociocultural standpoint, scholars have long emphasised the role of mass communication in shaping public opinion. Lippmann as well as McCombs and Shaw, for instance, demonstrated how media structures public perception by framing agendas and influencing salience. With the rise of digital and interactive platforms, communication has become increasingly complex, blending mass and interpersonal elements.<br><br>In sum, communication is not merely a tool for sharing opinions—it is a foundational mechanism through which opinions are formed, validated, and transformed within social contexts.<br><br><br><br></font></p>
